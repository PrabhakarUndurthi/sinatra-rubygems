h2. What is this?

An *almost* complete reimplementation of the @gem server@ command as a "Rack":http://rack.github.com/ application. Mostly, I need a properly mocked gem environment to test gemspec delivery.

h2. Uh, Why?

I really just wanted a RubyGems server running under Passenger instead of webrick. Makes sense.
